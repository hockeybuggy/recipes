# Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cup boiling water
- 1/2 cup cornmeal
- 1/4 cup molasses
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 egg
- 1 ounce package active dry yeast 1/4
- 3 cups all-purpose flour


# Directions

1. Combine the water, molasses, and butter. Stir it till it looks like the molasses is dissolved. 
2. Add the yeast, and let the yeast bloom for about 5 minutes. Then add the egg, and stir everything one more time.
3. Next add all the dry ingredients. Combine it until you have a dough ball, cover and let it rise for about 30 minutes.
4. Grease a 9 inch pie plate and spread the dough into the pie plate.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 (letting the dough rise for a secondish time while preheating) and bake the scones for about 25 minutes. You know it is done when sounds hollow when you tap them.
