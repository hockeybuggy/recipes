# Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup sugar, plus more for rolling
- 1/3 cup molasses
- 1 large egg


# Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. Whisk the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.

3. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until well combined, about 3 minutes.

4. Add the molasses and egg and beat until lighter in colour, about 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until well blended.

4. Using a tablespoon, form the dough into 1-inch balls and roll in sugar. Place each ball 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.

5. Bake until golden and crackled, 11 to 13 minutes; the cookies will still be a little soft. Baking these in 3 batches one sheet at a time gets you the nice, crackly top.

6. Allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, and then remove to a rack to cool completely.
