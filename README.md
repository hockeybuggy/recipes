# Some recipes

I was having a hard time finding recipes that I have tried before and liked. This repository is my attempt to collect some of them.

## Meta fields

The minimal YAML header of each recipe should:

```yaml
---
name: "Baked Alaska"
source_url: "https://example.com/baked_alaska"
time: "1h 30m"
---
```

Some other fields could be

```yaml
---
oven_temp: "Temperature of the oven"
yield: "number of units"
---
